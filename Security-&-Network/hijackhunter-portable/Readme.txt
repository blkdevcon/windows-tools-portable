# 3. Description

Hijack Hunter is an application that thoroughly scans your computer and 
displays all the gathered data in a comprehensive way. To help the users 
to detect suspicious system behaviors, our product shows all the needed 
information in a report file, taking care of all details, on running 
processes, registry startups keys, drivers installed, windows hijacks, 
browser helper objects and much more.

It is possible for the users to list files in custom folders and to dump 
the registry data from custom registry keys and values.

Hijack Hunter includes also some features that can list all the executable 
files that are in suspicious folders commonly used by malware. The 
program displays also hidden files in suspicious folders, executable 
files in Temp Folder and system parameters that are commonly hijacked 
by recent malware and spyware.
