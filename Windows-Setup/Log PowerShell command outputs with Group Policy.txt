Using the Group Policy option Turn on PowerShell Transcription (Computer Configuration –> Administrative Templates –> Windows Components –> Windows PowerShell), you can enable automatic logging of all run PowerShell commands and output on a computer. After updating GPO settings on the computer, a separate text log file will be created for each running powershell.exe process and all PS commands and their outputs will be logged.
